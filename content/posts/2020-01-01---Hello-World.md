I wanted to redesign my website for a while now. The previous version was a simple HTML + CSS website. However, I wanted a blog to share my experiences and important stuff that others might find useful. I still wanted to host it on Github though. It is free and easy to maintain. I had been looking into Jekyll but then I found [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Upon further research, I stumbled upon the [Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) theme. I found it sufficient for my purposes so here we are. 2020 has started and this is my website.
